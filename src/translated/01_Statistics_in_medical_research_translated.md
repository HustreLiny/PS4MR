# 1 医学研究中的统计学  1 Statistics in medical research  

一想到统计学，收藏家走过混乱的驻地花园，心中顿时充满喜悦……统计学不正是对混沌宇宙的整理吗？统计学是锁链，束缚着无知与迷信的恶徒，这些恶徒在孤寂的小径上扼杀真理。—J. G. Farrell，《克里希纳普尔围城记》  
At the thought of statistics, the Collector, walking through the chaotic Residency garden, felt his heart quicken with joy…. For what were statistics but the ordering of a chaotic universe？ Statistics were the leg- irons to be clapped on the thugs of ignorance and superstition which strangled Truth in lonely byways.J. G. Farrell, The Siege of Krishnapur

## 1.1 统计学的广泛应用  1.1 STATISTICS AT LARGE  

我们正受到前所未有的统计信息轰炸。报纸中充斥着大量统计数据，涉及贸易与工业、金融、（失业与就业）、交通事故数据等，还有频繁发布的民意调查和问卷调查结果。以这种方式呈现的统计信息可靠性参差不齐。尽管政治民意调查采用了相对可靠的方法，大多数调查则基于对某些便利群体的提问，且不考虑其代表性。甚至有些调查基于自愿提供的信息，如电话投票。  
We are bombarded with statistics to an unprecedented degree. Newspapers contain a wealth of statistical information, relating to trade and industry, finance, (un)employment, road accident figures and the like, and there are frequent results of opinion polls and surveys. Statistics presented in this way are of varying reliability. While political opinion polls are performed with reasonably reliable methods, most surveys are based on asking questions of some convenient group of people, with no concern for their representativeness. They may even be based on volunteered information, as in phone- in polls.  

媒体中也常见医学研究报道。研究结果通常基于严谨的方法学，但由于结果可能以类似方式呈现，其可靠性差异未被广泛识别。例如，报纸会用类似措辞报道关于因沙门氏菌担忧而对鸡蛋消费态度的民意调查结果，以及流行病学研究调查避孕药使用与乳腺癌风险关系的结果。许多医学问题过于复杂，难以在报纸或电视的简短报道中得到充分处理。诸如核电站周围儿童白血病发病率升高的可能性，或饮用水中添加氟的致癌效应等话题，都需要深入探讨许多复杂问题。氟化物争论的复杂性可见一斑：一场法庭审理持续了201天，其中大量证据为统计数据（Oldham，1985年）。  
It is also common to see reports of medical research in the media. Research findings are usually based on sound methodology, but as the results may be presented in a like manner the distinction in reliability is not widely perceived. For example, newspapers will report in similar terms the findings of a poll about attitudes to consumption of eggs in the light of worries about salmonella and also the results of an epidemiological study investigating the relation between use of the contraceptive pill and risk of breast cancer. Many medical issues are really too complex to be dealt with adequately in a short item in a newspaper or on television. Topics such as the possibility of raised rates of childhood leukaemia around nuclear power stations or the carcinogenic effect of adding fluoride to drinking water require an in- depth consideration of many complicated issues. The complexity of the fluoride debate may be judged by the fact that a court case lasted 201 days, with much of the evidence being statistical (Oldham, 1985).  

“研究”一词具有强烈的内涵，隐含着可靠性的保证。领域外的人很少关心研究是如何进行的，只关注研究结果。我曾见过一个广告利用了这一弱点。该公司在推广桌面装订系统时开头就说：“研究显示，精心呈现的文件被正确阅读和良好接受的概率提高了95%。”我怀疑是否真的做过这样的研究，甚至是否可能做，但“研究”的力量被成功地借用。  
The word 'research' has powerful connotations, with reliability being implicit. Few people outside the relevant field are concerned about how the research was done, only about what was found. One recent advertisement I have seen makes use of this weakness. The company supports its promotion of desk top binding systems with the opening comment that 'Research shows that a well presented document stands a  $95\%$  better chance of being properly read and well received'. I doubt whether any such research had been carried out, or even if it could be, but the power of research is successfully invoked.  

与这段荒谬言论形成鲜明对比的是以下来自报纸报道（《卫报》，1986年8月23日）的一段医学期刊论文摘要：  
At the other extreme from this piece of nonsense is the following excerpt from a newspaper report (Guardian, 23 August 1986) of a paper in a medical journal:  


> **心脏风险评分系统**  
> **Score system for heart risk**  
>  
> 医生们昨天宣布，已设计出一种廉价的“速算表”，用于识别高风险心脏病发作男性。昂贵的心电图测试和血胆固醇测量可以被简单的评分系统取代。该系统能识别出超过一半未来五年内可能发生心脏病发作的男性，他们随后可被建议采取更健康的生活方式或接受治疗。……该系统需要测量血压，估计吸烟年限，了解既往是否患有心绞痛、心脏病发作或糖尿病，以及父母中是否有人死于心脏病。  
> A cheap 'ready reckoner' for identifying men at high risk of a heart attack has been devised by doctors it was announced yesterday. Expensive electrocardiograph tests and measurements of blood cholesterol levels can be supplanted by a simple scoring system. The system can identify more than half of the men likely to have a heart attack over the next five years, who can then be advised to adopt a healthier lifestyle or offered treatment. … The system requires measurement of blood pressure, an estimate of the number of years of cigarette smoking, knowledge of previous angina, heart attack or diabetes, and whether either parent died of heart trouble.  

显然，这项研究对成千上万的男性具有潜在价值。这些结果可靠吗？“速查表”是如何制定的？当然，我们不会指望从一篇简短的报纸文章中获得这些信息，但没有提供研究是如何进行的细节，这使得这项研究与同一报纸中报道的其他统计数据没有本质区别。  
Clearly this study is potentially valuable to thousands of men. Are these results reliable and how was the 'ready reckoner' devised？ Of course we would not expect to obtain this information from a short newspaper article, but the fact that no information is given about how the study was performed may put it in no better light than any other statistics reported in the same newspaper.  

另一个例子是一篇报纸文章（《卫报》，1988年5月19日），报道了一项关于寿命与左撇子关系的研究：  
Another example is given by a newspaper article (Guardian, 19 May 1988) reporting a study of the relation between longevity and left- handedness:  


> **科学家说，左撇子的老人不多了**  
> **Not many old hands left, says scientist**  
>  
> 如果你超过80岁且是左撇子，你就是独一无二的。几乎所有其他左撇子都已经去世……昨晚哈珀恩博士说，这只是一个小样本。科学家们普遍发现，直到33岁之前，死亡率没有差异；从那时起，左撇子慢慢减少。  
> If you're over 80 and left-handed, you're in a class of your own. Nearly all the other left-handers have passed on… It was, said Dr Halpern last night, a small sample. Generally the scientists found that there was no difference in death rates up till the age of 33; from then the left-handed slowly fade away.  
>  
> 她提出了几个原因。一个可能是低体重婴儿倾向于成为左撇子，而低出生体重可能意味着生存机会减少。另一个原因是这是一个右手为主的世界。左撇子在使用汽车和电动工具时处于劣势，承受更大压力，事故也更多。  
> She offered several reasons. One might be that low-weight babies tended to be left-handed, and low birthweight might mean reduced chances of survival. The other was that it was a right-handed world. The left-handed were simply at a disadvantage with automobiles and power tools, suffered from greater stress and had more accidents.  

我将在第5章解释为何这项研究结果的解释不成立。目前我只想指出，这项研究的发现被不加批判地报道，最后一段包含未经支持的推测，这些推测甚至未出现在出版物中（Halpern和Coren，1988）。报纸读者无法辨别这两篇报道中信息的可靠性。然而，科学标准的差异，也就是研究结果的有效性，正是医学研究争议的根源。这些争议常常影响日常生活，使公众对许多食物和药物的潜在健康危害感到困惑（Feinstein，1988）。  
I shall explain in Chapter 5 why the interpretation of the results from this study is not valid. For the moment I shall just note that the study findings are reported uncritically, and the last paragraph contains unsupported speculations which do not even appear in the publication (Halpern and Coren, 1988). There is no way that readers of the newspaper could distinguish the reliability of the information in the two newspaper reports. Yet it is variation in scientific standards, and hence the validity of research findings, that fuels controversies in medical research. These often impinge on daily life, such that the public becomes confused about possible adverse health effects of numerous foods and drugs (Feinstein, 1988).  

通常，报道重点放在结果上（被当作事实呈现），而很少或根本不关注获取结果的方法，这可能是统计学被广泛视为仅与数据分析和数字结果呈现相关的原因。虽然这些确实是统计学的重要部分，但统计学远不止于此。尤其是数据如何以及为何被收集，这一点极其重要。  
In general the emphasis is on results (which are presented as facts), with little or no regard to the manner in which they were obtained, which is probably why the subject of statistics is widely seen as relating solely to the analysis of data and the presentation of numerical results. While these are important parts of statistics, there is much else besides. In particular, how and why the data were collected are supremely important.  

统计学（或统计学家）普遍被认为不可信，这种看法体现在“统计数据可以证明任何事情”的说法中。如果这句话有意义，它表明数字可以以多种方式呈现，且通常会选择最有利的视角。虽然这种看法有其理由，但“统计可以证明任何事情”并不正确；至少在研究中使用的统计方法方面，情况正好相反。统计分析让我们能够界定不确定性的范围，但不能证明任何事情。尽管存在对统计学的相当不信任，公众却往往无批判地接受研究结果，这可能归因于印刷文字的影响力。  
There is a wide perception of statistics (and perhaps statisticians too) as untrustworthy, as embodied in the idea that 'you can prove anything with statistics'. This saying, if it means anything, suggests that figures can be presented in a variety of ways, and that it is common for the most favourable view to be selected. While there is justification for this belief, it is not true that you can prove anything with statistics; the opposite is true, at least with regard to statistical methods used in research. Statistical analysis allows us to put limits on our uncertainty, but not to prove anything. Despite considerable mistrust of statistics, there is a tendency towards uncritical acceptance by the public of research findings, which may be attributed to the power of the printed word.  


## 1.2 医学中的统计学  1.2 STATISTICS IN MEDICINE  

统计学在医学实践中日益普及。如今，医院效用统计、审计、资源分配、疫苗接种率、艾滋病新发病例数等问题备受关注。医生的期刊和杂志充满了这类统计材料以及个别研究的结果。统计问题隐含于所有临床实践中，无论是做诊断还是选择合适的治疗方案。  
Statistics are increasingly prevalent in medical practice. Nowadays much concern is devoted to hospital utility statistics, audit, resource allocation, vaccination uptake, numbers of new cases of AIDS, and so on. Journals and magazines for doctors are full of statistical material of this sort, as well as the findings of individual research studies. Statistical issues are implicit in all clinical practice when making diagnoses and choosing an appropriate treatment.  

在药物（尤其是药物）和其他医疗疗法的宣传材料中引用研究论文中的统计结果变得越来越常见。举例来说，以下文字摘自1989年发表在临床肿瘤学杂志上的一则白血病治疗广告（我仅更改了药物名称）：  
It is increasingly common to see statistical results from research papers quoted in promotional materials for drugs (especially) and other medical therapies. As an example, the following text is from an advertisement for a treatment for leukaemia appearing in a clinical oncology journal in 1989 (I have only changed the names of the drugs):  


> **NOVORAN首次疗程反应者显著更多**  
> **Significantly more first-course responders with NOVORAN**  
>  
> - 在所有接受NOVORAN治疗的成人ANLL患者中，完全缓解率为63%，而接受orsoran治疗的患者为53%  $(\mathbf{P} = 0.15)$  
> -  $63\%$  of all adults with ANLL treated with NOVORAN had a complete remission, compared with  $53\%$  of all patients treated with orsoran  $(\mathbf{P} = 0.15)$  
>  
> - 接受NOVORAN诱导治疗一疗程后，56%的患者达到完全缓解，而接受orsoran治疗的患者为36%  $(\mathbf{P}< 0.01)$  
> -  $56\%$  of patients had a complete remission after one induction course with NOVORAN, compared with  $36\%$  of patients treated with orsoran  $(\mathbf{P}< 0.01)$  
>  
> - 对NOVORAN完全缓解的患者中，有89%在单次诱导疗程后响应，而对orsoran完全缓解的患者中仅为68%。  
> -  $89\%$  of complete responders to NOVORAN responded after a single induction course, compared with only  $68\%$  of complete responders to orsoran.  
>  
> - 单自由度 $\chi^2$ 检验  
> - Single df $\chi^2$  

要理解这段文字，必须知道诸如 $\mathbf{\nabla}^{\bullet}\mathbf{P} = 0.15^{\circ}$ 这类表达式的含义，以及可能还要理解那个奇怪的脚注。更重要的是，我们还想知道研究的规模和设计。因此，了解这些百分比是如何获得的及其解释方法，对于所有治疗患者的人员来说至少是有用的，甚至可以说是必不可少的。（本例中无法获得这些信息，因为该研究结果被报告为“存档”，即未发表。）  
To understand this passage it is necessary to know the meaning of expressions like  $\mathbf{\nabla}^{\bullet}\mathbf{P} = 0.15^{\circ}$  , and perhaps also the curious footnote. More importantly, however, we should wish to know how large the study was and what the design was. An appreciation of the methods by which these percentages were obtained and how to interpret them is thus at least useful and arguably essential for all those who treat patients. (We cannot obtain the information in this case as the results of this study were reported as being 'on file', i.e. unpublished.)  

对于从事研究的人来说，统计问题是根本性的，因此理解与研究设计和数据分析相关的基本统计理念，并熟悉最常用的统计分析方法，极为重要。  
For those doing research statistical issues are fundamental, and so it is extremely important to understand basic statistical ideas relating to research design and data analysis, and to be familiar with the most common methods of statistical analysis.  


## 1.3 医学研究中的统计学  1.3 STATISTICS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH  

Colton（1974，第1页）指出“统计学渗透于医学文献之中”。此后，统计学在医学研究中的大量涌入持续不断。其目的是提高医学研究结果的可靠性和可信度，但并不保证统计方面处理得当甚至有效。正如我将在最后一章中展示的，有大量证据表明许多已发表论文存在统计错误。  
Colton (1974, p.1) observed that 'statistics pervades the medical literature'. Since then the huge influx of statistics into medical research has continued. The aim is to improve the reliability and credibility of the findings from medical research, but there is no guarantee that the statistical aspects have been handled well or even validly. As I shall show in the final chapter, there is considerable evidence that many published papers contain statistical errors.  

统计学中的错误之所以值得关注，有很多原因。最简单地说，如果存在统计错误，研究的结论可能是错误的。论文的读者可能不会发现错误，从而在临床实践或后续研究中被误导。虽然这一论点可能高估了单篇发表论文的影响力，但有大量证据表明，医学期刊的读者以及公众通常会不加批判地接受印刷的内容。  
There are many reasons why errors in statistics are a matter for concern. Put most simply, if there are statistical errors the conclusions of the study may be incorrect. Readers of the paper may not detect the error and may be misled either with respect to clinical practice or further research. While this argument may overestimate the influence of a single published paper, there is much evidence that readers of medical journals accept uncritically the printed word, as does the general public.  

还有一种类似的看法认为统计学就是数据分析，或许因为这是统计贡献中最显而易见的部分。数据分析无疑是统计学的重要组成部分，但这种狭隘的观点  
There is also a similar belief that statistics is about data analysis, perhaps because this is the most visible part of the statistical contribution. Data analysis is certainly an important part of statistics, but this narrow view  

特别排除了与研究设计相关的关键方面。没有良好设计的坚实基础，分析的结构是不安全的。可靠的结果依赖于适当的研究设计：“分析的正当性不在于收集的数据本身，而在于数据的收集方式”（Schoolman 等，1968）。医学中许多争议都可以追溯到研究设计质量的差异。  
excludes in particular vital aspects relating to the design of research. Without the solid foundations of a good design the edifice of analysis is unsafe. Reliable results depend upon an appropriate research design: 'The justification for the analysis lies not in the data collected but in the manner in which the data were collected' (Schoolman et al., 1968). Many controversies in medicine are traceable to varying quality of the design of the research.  


## 1.4 统计学涵盖哪些内容？  1.4 WHAT DOES STATISTICS COVER？  

图1.1展示了研究项目的一般步骤序列。统计思维可以贯穿每个阶段，尽管设计、分析和解释这几个主要步骤将是本书的重点。  
Figure 1.1 shows the general sequence of steps in a research project. Statistical thinking can contribute to every stage, although the major steps of design, analysis and interpretation will be the prime focus of this book.  

医学研究与临床实践的关键区别在于其范围。两者都从个体受试者收集数据，但医学研究的目标是能够对更广泛的受试者群体做出一些普遍性陈述，而我们通常并不特别关注所研究的具体个体。因此，我们使用来自样本个体的信息，对类似个体的更大群体进行推断。加粗的三个词是正式的统计术语，将在后续章节中详细解释。这里重要的一点是，所研究的受试者充当了感兴趣总体的代表。  
The key difference between medical research and clinical practice is their scope. In each, data are collected from individual subjects, but in medical research the aim is to be able to make some general statements about a wider set of subjects, and we are not usually especially interested in the particular subjects that have been studied. We thus use information from a sample of individuals to make some inference about the wider population of like individuals. The three words in bold are formal statistical terms that will be explained fully in later chapters. The important point here is that the subjects who are studied act as a proxy for the total group of interest.

### 1.4.1 研究设计  1.4.1 Research design  

我们不可能研究所有糖尿病患者、所有孕妇或某一地理区域内的所有人。例如，如果我们希望研究孕期母体体重增加与婴儿出生体重之间的关系，就必须研究一组孕妇样本。该研究的目标是将样本的发现推广到所有孕妇。为了使这种推断合理，样本必须具有代表性。理论上，只有通过随机选择女性（第5章将解释这一概念）才能获得真正具有代表性的样本，但即便如此，样本也仅限于特定时间段和地理区域。实际上，样本几乎总是系统性选取，并描述受试者的特征，以便判断其代表性。刚才提到的研究可能通过在特定时间段内选取一个或多个医院登记的所有孕妇来进行。在大多数研究中，需要排除某些人群。这里，晚期登记的孕妇必须排除，因为她们无法提供足够的体重数据。众所周知，这部分人群在许多方面并不典型。我们可能还会排除早产儿（<37周），以及其他一些次要的排除原因，如糖尿病和双胞胎。  
We can never study all diabetics, all pregnant women, or all people living in a geographical area. If we wish to investigate, for example, the relation between maternal weight gain in pregnancy and baby's birth weight we must study a sample of pregnant women. The aim of this research would be to extrapolate the findings from this sample to all pregnancies. For this inference to be reasonable, it is necessary for the sample of women to be representative of all pregnant women. In theory we can obtain a truly representative sample only by choosing women at random (a concept explained in Chapter 5) but even then the sample would be specific to a time period and geographical area. In practice, samples are nearly always chosen systematically and the subjects' characteristics are described so that their representativeness can be judged. The study just proposed would probably be carried out by taking all women registering at one or more specific hospitals in a set time period. In most studies it is necessary to exclude some people. Here women registering late in pregnancy would have to be excluded because they would not provide sufficient weight data. It is well known that this group is untypical in many respects. We might also wish to exclude premature births (<37 weeks) and there would probably be some other minor reasons for exclusion, such as diabetes and twins.  

通常，研究报告会列出纳入和排除受试者的标准，并描述样本在研究开始时的重要特征；在本例中，包括年龄、产次（既往生育子女数）、身高和体重。随后，是否合理将样本研究结果视为所有孕妇的代表，则属于主观判断。  
It is customary for the report of such a study to list the criteria for including or excluding subjects in the study, and to describe important characteristics of the sample at the start of the study; in this case these would include age, parity (number of previous children), height and weight. It is then a subjective matter to decide whether or not it is reasonable to take the findings from the study sample as being representative of all pregnant women.  

比较研究涉及与刚才描述的观察性研究相同的考虑因素。例如，我们可能希望比较接受不同饮食建议的女性群体。在这里，我们还面临如何决定哪些女性接受哪种建议的问题。我们希望采用一种方法，使两组女性在年龄、产次和孕前体重上相似。此外，我们希望该方法排除对接受何种建议的主观影响。  
A comparative study would involve the same considerations as the observational study just described. For example, we might wish to compare groups of women given different dietary advice. Here we have the additional issue of how to decide which women get which advice. We would like a method that would result in the women in the two groups being of similar age, parity and pre- pregnancy weight. Further, we want a method that excludes the possibility of subjective influence on who receives which advice.  

上述所有问题都属于设计的范畴，因此是统计学对研究的贡献之一。另一个方面是确定研究的合适样本量。我希望这个例子能说明为什么正确的设计是良好研究的关键部分，因此在研究早期阶段获得良好的统计学支持非常重要。每个研究都会遇到不同的问题，但有许多良好设计的一般原则，这些将在第5章中讨论。  
All the issues just described come under the broad heading of design. and are thus part of the statistical contribution to research. Another aspect is determination of a suitable sample size for the study. I hope that this example has illustrated some of the reasons why a correct design is an essential part of good research, and thus the importance of good statistical input at this early stage. Different problems arise in each study, but there are many general principles for good design, which are discussed in  

临床试验将在第15章详细介绍。  
Chapter 5. Clinical trials are considered in detail in Chapter 15.  

研究设计的基础性作用导致研究论文中最重要的部分是方法部分。我们在这里了解研究是如何进行的，以及结果是否有用。例如，仅在体重高于平均水平的女性中进行的孕期体重增加研究，或仅限于低出生体重婴儿的妊娠，可能无论结果如何都缺乏意义；在英国进行的研究可能对非洲或亚洲的情况参考价值有限。更一般地说，我们不能从不具代表性或有偏样本中做出有效的推广。避免偏倚是健全研究设计的主要目标之一。  
A consequence of the fundamental role of study design is that the most important part of a research paper is the Methods section. It is here that we learn what was done and if the results will be useful. A study of maternal weight gain carried out only on women of above average weight or restricted to pregnancies ending with low birth weight babies might be of no interest, regardless of the findings, and a study carried out in Britain may be of little relevance to the situation in Africa or Asia. Put more generally, we cannot make valid generalizations from unrepresentative or biased samples. The avoidance of bias is one of the main aims of sound research design.  

前述高心脏病风险男性研究的报告发表于《英国医学杂志》（Shaper 等，1986）。其论文中的“受试者与方法”部分（此处略有删减）详细描述了研究的具体实施：  
The report of the aforementioned study of men at high risk of heart attacks was published in the British Medical Journal (Shaper et al., 1986). The 'Subjects and Methods' section of their paper (slightly shortened here) described exactly how the study was carried out:  

数据来源于英国区域心脏研究，该研究调查了7735名年龄在40至59岁的男性，这些男性是从英格兰、威尔士和苏格兰24个城镇具有代表性的全科诊所的年龄-性别登记册中随机选取的。24个城镇的人口均在5万至10万之间，涵盖了心血管疾病死亡率的全范围，并包括所有主要标准区域。每个城镇选定的全科诊所的社会阶层分布代表该城镇。男性受试者是从年龄-性别登记册中随机选取的；未尝试排除患有心血管疾病的个体，且响应率为78%。  
The data used were derived from the British Regional Heart Study, which examined 7735 men aged 40- 59 randomly selected from the age- sex registers of representative group general practices in 24 towns in England, Wales and Scotland. The 24 towns were selected from those with populations of 50 000- 100 000; they represented the full range of cardiovascular disease mortality and included towns in all the major standard regions. The general practice selected in each town had a social class distribution representative of the town. The men were selected at random from age- sex registers; no attempt was made to exclude subjects with cardiovascular disease, and there was a  $78\%$  response rate.  

研究护士向每位男性发放问卷并完成体检。在本研究中，吸烟暴露以吸烟年数表示，不考虑吸烟量，因为吸烟年数与缺血性心脏病风险的关联最强。若受试者在问卷中表示运动时（如上坡行走或快走）出现胸痛，则视为患有心绞痛，包括明确和可能的心绞痛。本论文结果仅限于7506名（占97%）在上述所有风险因素上数据完整的男性。  
Research nurses administered a questionnaire to and completed an examination of each man. In this study exposure to cigarette smoking was expressed as the number of years a man had smoked, irrespective of the quantity, as this was most strongly related to risk of ischaemic heart disease. Subjects were regarded as having angina if they indicated on the questionnaire that chest pain was present on exertion (walking uphill or hurrying). This included definite and possible angina. Results in this paper are confined to the 7506 men  $(97\%)$  with complete data on all the above risk factors.  

只有掌握了这些信息和分析方法的细节，我们才能对作者的结论是否适用于所有40至59岁男性做出恰当评估。超出该年龄范围的推断是不明智的。  
Only when armed with this information and details of the methods of analysis, can we make a proper assessment of the appropriateness of the authors' conclusions to all men aged 40- 59. Extrapolation outside this age range is unwise.  

然而，如果论文遗漏了重要信息，我们必须对其结论保持审慎。我将在最后一章讨论此类问题以及阅读医学论文的其他相关问题。  
If, however, important information is omitted from a paper, then we must reserve judgement on the findings. I consider this and other issues regarding reading medical papers in the final chapter.  


### 1.4.2 分析与解释  1.4.2 Analysis and interpretation  

尽管有上述评论，数据分析仍是学习统计学的主要部分。分析方法多达数十种，这使得为特定案例选择正确的方法变得困难。然而，在关注具体方法之前，有必要考虑所有分析方法背后的哲学思想。我们将看到，统计分析方法基于一个关键理念：利用样本数据对更广泛的人群进行推断。当然，具体方法很重要，但首先需要掌握一般原则。第8章将讨论数据统计分析的主要一般方法，然后再介绍具体方法。  
Despite the preceding comments the analysis of data is the major part of learning about statistics. There are dozens of different methods of analysis, which makes difficult the choice of the correct method for a particular case. Before worrying about particular methods, however, it is necessary to consider the philosophy that underlies all methods of analysis. We will see that statistical methods of analysis are based on the same key idea that we use data from a sample to draw inferences about a wider population. Of course particular methods are important, but the general principles need to be absorbed first. The main general approaches to the statistical analysis of data are considered in Chapter 8, before particular methods are introduced.  

统计分析结果的解释并非总是直观明了，但当研究目标明确且理解分析背后的基本原则时，解释会更简单。事实上，如果研究设计合理且分析正确，结果的解释可以相当简单。  
The interpretation of results of statistical analysis is not always straightforward, but is simpler when the study has a clear aim and when there is an appreciation of the general principles that underlie the analysis. Indeed, if the study has been well designed and correctly analysed the interpretation of results can be fairly simple.  


## 1.5 本书的范围  1.5 THE SCOPE OF THIS BOOK  

本书试图在介绍具体数据分析方法之前，突出统计设计和分析的概念与原则。因此，直到第9章才开始描述更常见的分析方法。前几章涵盖基础内容，包括设计和分析的主要思想、可能遇到的不同数据类型，以及如何使用计算机进行统计分析。第9至12章介绍主要的统计分析方法，第13至15章则讨论特定医学主题。第16章关注统计学在医学文献中的应用，并提供关于统计内容的医学论文阅读与写作建议。  
In this book I have tried to give prominence to the concepts and principles of statistical design and analysis before considering specific methods of analysing data. Thus it is not until Chapter 9 that I start to describe the more familiar methods of analysis. The earlier chapters cover basic material including, as well as the main ideas of design and analysis, consideration of different types of data that may be encountered and advice on how to use a computer for statistical analysis. Chapters 9 to 12 describe the main methods of statistical analysis, while Chapters 13 to 15 consider specific medical topics. In Chapter 16 I look at the way statistics is used in the medical literature, and give advice on reading and writing medical papers with respect to the statistical content.  

医学研究大致分为临床研究、实验室研究和流行病学，这些领域分别涉及人、人体样本或人群。每种情况下，研究对象可能是健康人和病人的混合体。我使用“临床”一词涵盖外科、牙科、护理、心理学等领域的研究。  
Medical research falls into the broad areas of clinical research, laboratory research and epidemiology, which may be regarded as relating to people, samples from people or populations of people. In each case the individuals studied may be a mixture of healthy and ill people. I use the term 'clinical' to include research in surgery, dentistry, nursing, psychology and so on.  

本书描述的统计方法适用于上述所有领域，尽管具体问题可能有所不同。然而，流行病学具有许多特殊特点和统计方法，这些内容在专业书籍中有详尽介绍。  
The statistical methods described in this book apply to all of these areas, although the specific problems may vary. Epidemiology, however, has many special features and statistical methods, which are covered comprehensively in specialized texts.  

编写统计学教材时遇到的一个问题是读者对数学方法熟悉程度的差异。  
One problem when writing a statistics textbook is the likely variation among readers in their familiarity with mathematical methods. I have  

为帮助不太擅长数学的读者，我采用了两种措施。首先，附录A中包含了数学符号表，简要解释所有使用的术语。其次，大多数章节将数学公式放在独立部分，便于读者阅读特定方法时不被复杂的公式分心。虽然使用计算机时不必掌握公式，但它们展示了分析的原理，除非极度敏感，我建议读者应当学习这些公式。后面章节中的高级方法未包含公式，因为它们非常复杂，且分析总是在计算机上完成。  
adopted two devices to assist those who are less than comfortable with mathematics. Firstly, I have included an Appendix on mathematical notation (Appendix A), which includes brief explanations of all the terms used. Secondly, in most chapters I have put the mathematical formulae in self- contained sections, so that it is possible to read about a particular method without being confused or distracted by sometimes formidable looking equations. Although the formulae are not needed when using a computer, they do show the way in which the analysis works, and except in cases of extreme hypersensitivity I recommend that they should be examined. For the more advanced methods in later chapters I have not included the mathematical formulae as these are very complicated and the analyses are always done on a computer.  

记忆公式并非必要—可以查阅。重要的是理解研究过程的一般原则，从制定目标到图1.1所示的各步骤，并意识到可推断内容的局限性。  
It is not necessary to be able to remember formulae - these can be looked up. What is important is to understand the general principles of the research process, from formulating an objective through all the steps shown in Figure 1.1, and to be aware of the limitations of what may or may not be deduced.  

我不假装统计学容易学。相反，我认为它相当困难。统计学是数学、逻辑和判断力的奇妙结合。尽管许多人因数学而望而却步，但逻辑过程往往更具挑战性—良好设计的原则，以及数据分析和解释背后的概念。如果统计学仅是简单数学的延伸，学习会更直接。期望与现实的差距导致许多问题，产生对统计学的厌恶、挫败感，甚至泪水。过去有人曾说：“事实是，我们大多数人讨厌统计分析，任何借口都愿意避免它”（Seddon，1937）。幸运的是，这并非必然。我希望本书采用的方法能使读者较为轻松地理解统计学。  
I do not pretend that statistics is easy to learn. On the contrary, I think it is rather difficult. Statistics is a curious amalgam of mathematics, logic and judgement. Although many are put off by the mathematics, it is often the logical processes that cause more difficulty - the principles of good design, and the concepts underlying data analysis and interpretation. If statistics were what many people expect, namely an extension of simple mathematics, it would be more straightforward. The mismatch between expectation and reality leads to many problems, a dislike of the subject, frustration and maybe even tears. In the past it has led to remarks such as the following: 'The truth of the matter is that most of us detest statistical analysis and welcome any excuse to dispense with it' (Seddon, 1937). Fortunately this is not an inevitable pathway. I hope that the approach that I have adopted in this book leads to a relatively painless acquisition of an understanding of statistics.
